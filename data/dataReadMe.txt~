U	Y	REF

File		Info
bigSineFile	1000,000 data points of sinusoidal functions with frequencies between 			1Hz to 100Hz in steps of 1Hz. Noise added with Noise-to-Signal ratio 			=10. Amplitude = 1 not including noise, with noise it goes to about 1.5

randomJump	600,000 data points of random jumps to a set point. Value of set point 			is between -0.2 and -3 and 0.2 and 3. The jumps last for 10 to 100 			time steps. No noise added

manySinesWithRef	Same as bigSineFile.txt but 10,000 data points frequency 				ranges from 10Hz to 100Hz in steps of 10. Amplitude = 1.

manySines	Same as manySinesWithRef but only contains [u y] data, not [u y ref]

testFile	File for testing the model, contains 1000 data points. This is a sine 			wave that is perturbed a little bit.

newMPCData	Not sure...
